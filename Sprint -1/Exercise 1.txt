Exercise  1 :  Understanding Database Structure

Tasks : 

1. Which column in the property table uniquely identifies each property ?

--> property_id (INT) column in the property table uniquely identifies each property.

--> Bcz this  property_id (INT) is the " Primary Key "  in the property table..

2. Explain the owner_id column connects the property table to the owner table ?

--> Here We need to talk about keys in SQL like there are 2 types of keys 

1.Primary Key
2.Foregin Key

--> In owner table owner_id acts as a Primary key ...

--> At the same time owner_id acts as a foreign key in the property table.
